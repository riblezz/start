    <h2>My little story about my journey</h2>
    <p><em>I wanted to be a front end developer out of the blue. At first my path was towards python backend which didn't last long, 
        and after that I wanted to be an android developer and that came out longer.
         It was all good, but i wanted to try something else and realize what i actually really like doing.
          So, I started doing that and this is my first website. <strong>Hopefully it's something I'll enjoy.</strong></em></p>
